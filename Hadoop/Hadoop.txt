What is Hadoop?

Apache Hadoop is an open source framework that is used to efficiently store and process large datasets ranging in size from gigabytes to petabytes of data. Instead of using one large computer to store and process the data, Hadoop allows clustering multiple computers to analyze massive datasets in parallel more quickly.




What are the four main modules of Hadoop?

Hadoop consists of four main modules:

Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) – A distributed file system that runs on standard or low-end hardware. HDFS provides better data throughput than traditional file systems, in addition to high fault tolerance and native support of large datasets.
Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN) – Manages and monitors cluster nodes and resource usage. It schedules jobs and tasks.
MapReduce – A framework that helps programs do the parallel computation on data. The map task takes input data and converts it into a dataset that can be computed in key value pairs. The output of the map task is consumed by reduce tasks to aggregate output and provide the desired result.
Hadoop Common – Provides common Java libraries that can be used across all modules.
How does Hadoop work?
Hadoop makes it easier to use all the storage and processing capacity in cluster servers, and to execute distributed processes against huge amounts of data. Hadoop provides the building blocks on which other services and applications can be built.

Applications that collect data in various formats can place data into the Hadoop cluster by using an API operation to connect to the NameNode. The NameNode tracks the file directory structure and placement of “chunks” for each file, replicated across DataNodes. To run a job to query the data, provide a MapReduce job made up of many map and reduce tasks that run against the data in HDFS spread across the DataNodes. Map tasks run on each node against the input files supplied, and reducers run to aggregate and organize the final output.
